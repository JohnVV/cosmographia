* Phobos mesh - Converted from shape model created by Peter Thomas (m1phobos.tab)
available here:
http://sbn.psi.edu/ferret/data_set_details.do?dataSetId=EAR-A-5-DDR-SHAPE-MODELS-V2.1

* Phobos map - Rescaled mosaic of images from ESA's Mars Express spacecraft:
   http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEMXE6RTKMF_Austria_1.html

* Deimos mesh - Converted from shape model created by Peter Thomas; available
  from the same source as the Phobos mesh.

* Meshes of asteroids 243 Ida, 4 Vesta, and 951 Gaspra; Saturnian satellites
  Janus, Epimetheus, and Hyperiod are also from models created by Peter
  Thomas

* The models of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and asteroid 2867 Steins were
translated from SPICE shape kernels. The ultimate source of this data is
unknown, as there is no reference given in the comment section of the SPICE
kernel files. The SPICE files may be download from here:
   ftp://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/generic_kernels/dsk/

* Model of asteroid 4179 Toutatis was generated from a data set by
Scott Hudson. The modeling of Toutatis from radar imaging is described in
the paper "High-Resolution Model of Asteroid 4179 Toutatis" by Hudson et al,
